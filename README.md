## Task
This week your challenge is an on-the-job ticket, which means you'll begin with starter code that you need to modify. This week's challenge involves a very important aspect of web development: **accessibility**. 
 
One of the most common tasks for front-end and junior developers is to take existing code and refactor it (recall that to refactor code is to improve it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology. In this challenge, a marketing agency has hired you to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible. 
 
Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Making a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities cannot access their website.
 
Even though accessibility is a broad topic that can include complex requirements, your tech lead has given you a small list of specific criteria to satisfy the project. These criteria are documented below in the Acceptance Criteria.
 
**Important**: An important rule to follow when working with someone else's code is the **Scout Rule**, which recommends that you always leave the code a little cleaner than when you found it.

To impress clients, you should always go the extra mile and improve the codebase for long-term sustainability. For example, make sure that all links are functioning correctly. Also, rework the CSS to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.

Are you ready to jump in? Here are this week's challenge requirements:

### User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

  * [x] Application's CSS file is properly commented.

#### Deployment: 32%

* [x] Application deployed at live URL.

* [x] Application loads with no errors.

* [x] Application GitHub URL submitted.

* [x] GitHub repository that contains application code.

#### Application Quality: 15%

* [x] *I believe so* Application resembles (at least 90%) screenshots provided in the challenge instructions.

* [x] Repository has a unique name.

* [x] *I believe so* Repository follows best practices for file structure and naming conventions.

* [x] *I believe so* Repository follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.

* [x] *I believe so - please see commit that notes several commits were made whilst the repo was a directory which can be found in my "Bootcamp-2022-2023/004_W1_Challenge" directory* Repository contains multiple descriptive commit messages.

* [x] Repository contains quality README file with description, screenshot, and link to deployed application.

### Review

You are required to submit the following for review:

* [x] The URL of the deployed application.

* [x] The URL of the GitHub repository. Give the repository a unique name and include a README describing the project.


### Resources:

* [Semantic HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp)
* [Image `alt` attributes](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_img_alt.asp)
